# CSS Experiments

This repository contains some of my experiments with CSS. Rather than only relying on external CSS libraries I would like to be able to use my own. In this light I am trying to become more proficient with CSS and practised by creating some elements of my own (although in large part inspired by the Bootstrap styling. See also [Bootstrap's website](https://getbootstrap.com)).

## Collaboration

I would love it if other people would like to collaborate, learn together and grow this CSS library. Everything in this repository is completely free to be used by anybody, anywhere, anytime. Because there is easily better stuff available online elsewhere, this is just my practise stuff.

## Tips & Suggestions

Anybody, **please** feel free to give me tips and pointers on anything. I am very new to web development and looking to improve. If you would like to help me, let me know what I can do better!

## Contact

If you do wish to collaborate on this, or other projects of your own, **please** do contact me. Always looking for new coding-friends online!
